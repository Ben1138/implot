# ImPlot
Advanced 2D Plotting for Dear ImGui

# Known Issues

- Mouse scroll zooming on a plot that is in scrollable ImGui region will both zoom and scroll the window since there is no built in scroll capture for ImGui. The current workaround is to CTRL+Scroll the plot (this disables window scrolling).
